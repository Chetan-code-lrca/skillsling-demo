- **🔒 Privacy First**: All data remains on the student's device. Ideal for school environments and areas with limited connectivity.
- **📚 NCERT & Facts-Aligned**: Integrated with a verified local fact database to ensure historical and scientific accuracy (e.g., precise "Drain Theory" data).
- **📝 Interactive Quiz Mode**: Generates customized tests based on the study session to reinforce learning.
